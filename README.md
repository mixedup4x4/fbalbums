A script to save all images from a facebook album, something which facebook doesn't provide an option for. 

Save yourself the trouble of clicking every single link of those 300 images.

Install the following libraries before running:
- Mechanize
- PyQuery

Enter your facebook username, password, the album name and the link to the album as mentioned in the script. 
Then just python script.py in the terminal (duh?)

Images will get saved in a folder with the name as given by the user.
The folder will be in the same directory as that of the script.
