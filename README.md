A script to save all images from a facebook album, something which facebook doesn't provide an option for. 

Save yourself the trouble of clicking every single link of those 300 images.

Install the following libraries before running:
    Mechanize
    PyQuery
  
Images will get saved in a folder with the name as given by the user.
The folder will be in the same directory as that of the script.
